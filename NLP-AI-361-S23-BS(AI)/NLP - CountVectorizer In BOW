Concept of Count-Vectorizer and why it is used? in Bag of words:

Count-Vectorizer is a feature extraction method used in natural language processing (NLP) and other text-based data analysis tasks.
The goal of this method is to convert a collection of documents into a numerical representation.
That representations can be used as input to machine learning algorithms.

Basic idea behind Count-Vectorizer is to take a set of documents and represent each document as a vector of word counts.
Where each element in the vector corresponds to the number of times a particular word occurs in the document.
This representation is often referred to as a "bag of words" representation.
Because the order of the words in the document is not taken into account.
For BOW and the only information retained is the frequency of occurrence of each word.

Count-Vectorizer is widely used in NLP because it is simple to implement, easy to interpret.
It can be used with a variety of algorithms,including those based on linear models, trees, and neural networks.
Additionally, it can handle text data that contains different levels of noise, such as misspelled words,
non-standard word forms, and stop words.

One potential drawback of using Count-Vectorizer is that it can lead to very high-dimensional representations.
especially when working with large corpora of text data.
This can result in the curse of dimensionality, where the number of features exceeds the number of instances.
This may lead to poor performance of machine learning algorithms.
To mitigate this problem, various feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques can be applied.
